# Data Science Portfolio.

A repo of data science projects completed for educational purposes, fun, and practice. All projects were completed using Jupyter Notebooks and Python and exported to html and uploaded here. 

A more visually and aesthetically pleasing experience can be found at [Github's pages](https://codeja3.github.io). The web page design there was made possible by the generocity of @ajlkn. 

## Overview of contents  

### Machine Learning

----

[Compressive strength of concrete](https://codeja3.github.io/concrete_data.html): a demonstration of how pipelines from the scikit learn library can be used to quickly examine multiple out-of-the-box algorithms and choose the best performing one for further fine tuning.  

### Statistics 

----

[Diabetes prevalence](https://codeja3.github.io/diabetes_prevalence_NCD.html): can you always rely on p-value of hypothesis testing to make judgements? This is a useful demo of effect size and why it matters.
