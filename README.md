# Data Science Portfolio.

A repo of data science projects completed for educational purposes, fun, and practice. All projects were completed using Jupyter Notebooks and Python and exported to html and uploaded here. 

A more visually and aesthetically pleasing experience can be found at [Github's pages](https://codeja3.github.io). The web page design there was made possible by the generocity of @ajlkn.
